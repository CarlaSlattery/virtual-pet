# Virtual Pet

Virtual pet is a Javascript project that creates a virtual pet using prototypes and allows you to look after it without all the mess and expense of a real pet.

# Features

Your pet will get older but you can help to keep it happy by feeding and walking it - in fact, please do this so that it doesn't reach a premature end.

# Project status

Currently in design!
